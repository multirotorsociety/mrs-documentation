# How to contribute
1. Clone the **DEV** branch (**DO NOT CLONE MASTER**)
2. Make your changes. Pages are written in markdown (`.md`) files that are found in the `docs` folder. Markdown formatting guide can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
3. MKDocs Material theme also supports extra extra extensions to make documentation easier to read or just nicer to look at. Information on this can be found [on the MKDocs Material page](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/).
4. If you are adding pages or changing the structure of the documentation site, update `mkdocs.yml` to reflect the new site structure. Read the [documentation here](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/creating-your-site/) to see how to update `mkdocs.yml`
5. Once you are satisfied with your changes, commit them to the **DEV** branch (**NOT THE MASTER BRANCH**)
6. Someone from EXCO will review the commit before merging it
