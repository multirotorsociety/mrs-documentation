# Contribution Guidelines

This documentation is not meant to be a guide that covers everything under the sky and should not attempt to cover information for PX4, ardupilot etc that is already available on their respective documentation sites.

What this documentation site should be is a way to point people in the right direction and help less experienced members understand high level documentation available.
