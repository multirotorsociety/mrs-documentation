# Propellers (Props)
Firstly, the things that create lift, the propellers.

!!! warning
	While this is the first section, this should always be put on **LAST** only after all other checks have been performed. ALWAYS CHECK YOUR SURROUNDINGS AND ASK SOMEONE WITH EXPERIENCE TO CHECK BEFORE PUTTING ON PROPELLERS FOR MAIDEN FLIGHT. Propellers can gravely injure people.

  Betaflight default X-frame quadcopter prop configuration

You would notice that the Motors marked 1 and 4 spin clockwise and the Motors marked 2 and 3 spin anticlockwise. Before placing the propellers, **ensure that the correct CW/CCW propellers are used for the correct motors**. 

!!! tip
	Some motors, typically older ones, come with self tightning nuts instead of locknuts. If the motors spin clockwise, the nut will be tightened anticlockwise(and vice versa). This prevents the propellers from loosening during flight.

Different frame configurations will have different motor directions. When in doubt, refer to the documentation on the flightstack(betaflight/PX4/Ardupilot) itself.
