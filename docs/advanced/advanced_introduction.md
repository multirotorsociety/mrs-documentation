# Introduction to ADVANCED Dronery

By this point, you should have built your workshop drone, flashed it with betaflight, and proceeded to maiden flight with it. However, to achieve autonomous or semi-autonomous functionality, a more powerful flight controller with a compatible firmware and more sensors are required for the drone to detect changes in its surroundings. This document will primarily focus on some of the required steps for autonomous flight and the interfacing of sensors with the two main autonomous flightstacks(Ardupilot and PX4).
