Overshooting the setpoints will result in oscillations and crashes. It takes time and experience to get the tune right. However , many other factors such as lack of dampening can cause excessive vibrations too, similarly loose screws or components that are not fastened down might generate issues. Visually inspect your drone and check for possible issues that might cause instability before attempting to get a perfect tune. PX4 PID Tuning Guide for Multicopters There are 3 sections, do read through the first 2(even briefly) unless a crash is desired. PID Tuning Explained by Oscarliang Sample AAVC Test Flight with bad tuning and many oscillations The Ardupilot PID Autotune Shortcut # Ardupilot has this rather convenient feature that allows it to autotune the PID in an open area. Ensure that altitude mode works first before binding the autotune function to a switch. The drone will use step inputs to determine the ideal rates for a sharp response. The AUTOTUNE_AXES param can be changed if your drone does not have enough battery life to tune all axis at once. It is highly recommended to use a GPS as this will allow the drone to maintain position despite windy conditions when autotune is activated from position hold. PID tuning only starts when both sticks are centered (ie the throttle will be at 50%), so ensure that altitude hold is tuned properly, more information below. Here are some very brief notes regarding PID tuning, much more indepth information is available online. PID calibration procedure # Unlike racing drones it is impractical for larger, specialized drones to be tuned while flying FPV in acro so a method demanding less of the pilot will be briefly covered below. This process will be easier with one person flying and having a physical feel for how the drone response while the other reads the graphs and changes the params to suit the ideal response and pilots preference. Firstly, use quick impulse inputs and tune for roll->pitch->yaw one axis at a time. These rapid inputs should only occur for less than a split second as we only want to see how fast it responds to the current input(ie inputting a impulse roll right input should cause the drone to momentarily tilt right. If it does not respond, the p is too low. If it starts to move right, then the roll input is too long and needs to be shorter.). Repeat the impulse inputs a few times and observe the immediate response to the step input while discarding any external interferences(such as wind or lose parts causing movements). Tuning outdoors is unadvisable(aside from autotune) because of this. Do note that if tuning is conducted midair, always use the 5% increment button to avoid causing big changes in control to the drone and crashing. For a balanced x-frame, you can expect the roll and pitch pids to be roughly the same, which speeds up tuning. For a H frame with the weight distributed along the y axis of the craft, the roll p-pid should be lower than the pitch p-pid as it is easier to roll. The pid graph in PX4 is under Tuning-> Advanced Perimeters. The estimated(Red) is the actual position of the craft while the setpoint(green) is what is desired, therefore the setpoint should hug the estimated as close as possible. 1) P, maximum value possible # Response Too high - high frequency oscillations(it will be both visible and audible) Too low - vehicle reacts too slowly Increase value until right before it starts oscillating in high frequency 2) D, minimum value possible # Dampening Too high - motors become twitchy and hot(because it overcorrects too quickly, which creates high frequency noise) Too low - overshoot after step input Find Minimum value required so that it corrects quickly(see from graph) even after large step inputs 3) I, balanced # Error Too high - slow oscillations ( as it slowly tries to correct) Too low - drift, HIGH FREQUENCY OSCILLATION AFTER STEP INPUT Increase if drifts in wind/external conditions, decrease if it corrects too slowly/little Recommended values are 0.3-0.5 on PX4 wiki Arguably, this is one of the hardest parts of setting up a drone as it requires experience to isolate and identify the actual response. Isolate - ideally speaking, tuning should be done in an indoor environment without wind but since that is not always possible with bigger drones and lack of space, just be aware that external factors such as wind can cause the response to move on its own. Do not overcompensate for it. Identify - One common issue is identifying high frequency oscillations from low frequency oscillations when first starting out. The default PIDs from PX4 are deliberately set low for safety but it can be more than doubled on some drones. The biggest tell of high frequency oscillations is that it should be very hard to even take off(unlike low frequency which is still often possible). The drone should both visibly and audibly be constantly vibrating and trying to correct, with little or not control as a result. As one might be unable to differentiate high from low frequency oscillations when tuning for the first time, the P tuning might be stopped at a much lower value than what the craft is actually capable of. Considering the size and price of the platform, it is understandable why this is more of an issue as compared to tuning an acro quad. Hence, it maybe useful to do a preliminary tuning of P,D,I and after it is sufficiently stable continue trying to increase P until it is uncontrollable. The live graphs for PID tuning can be found from the advanced option under the tuning tab. The parameters can be tuned on the fly incrementally. Example tuning process # Here are some images of a tuning process that will perhaps help to judge the feedback of your drone. It is by no means ideal but should aid in helping you to read the graph if you are struggling with identifying what is going on. Do not be overly reliant on the graphs, visual identification and the pilot feedback are as important when tuning. As previously mentioned, try inputting impulse commands with P and no I or D. In this picture, the response is smaller than the command. Hence, the P has to be increased for increased responsiveness of the drone and to ensure that the graphs are closer to one another. When the drone starts exhibiting high frequency oscillations, either reduce the P or start adding in D together with P if more responsiveness is still desired. In this graph, the drone oscillates after an impulse input. More D is required to dampen the response quicker. This graph looks pretty okay but the response looks abit slow so the I can be reduced.

Visually inspect your drone and check for possible issues that might cause instability before attempting to get a perfect tune. PX4 PID Tuning Guide for Multicopters There are 3 sections, do read through the first 2(even briefly) unless a crash is desired. PID Tuning Explained by Oscarliang Sample AAVC Test Flight with bad tuning and many oscillations","title":"PID Tuning"},{"location":"advanced/pid_tuning/#the-ardupilot-pid-autotune-shortcut","text":"Ardupilot has this rather convenient feature that allows it to autotune the PID in an open area. Ensure that altitude mode works first before binding the autotune function to a switch. The drone will use step inputs to determine the ideal rates for a sharp response. The AUTOTUNE_AXES param can be changed if your drone does not have enough battery life to tune all axis at once. It is highly recommended to use a GPS as this will allow the drone to maintain position despite windy conditions when autotune is activated from position hold. PID tuning only starts when both sticks are centered (ie the throttle will be at 50%), so ensure that altitude hold is tuned properly, more information below. Here are some very brief notes regarding PID tuning, much more indepth information is available online.","title":"The Ardupilot PID Autotune Shortcut"},{"location":"advanced/pid_tuning/#pid-calibration-procedure","text":"Unlike racing drones it is impractical for larger, specialized drones to be tuned while flying FPV in acro so a method demanding less of the pilot will be briefly covered below. This process will be easier with one person flying and having a physical feel for how the drone response while the other reads the graphs and changes the params to suit the ideal response and pilots preference. Firstly, use quick impulse inputs and tune for roll->pitch->yaw one axis at a time. These rapid inputs should only occur for less than a split second as we only want to see how fast it responds to the current input(ie inputting a impulse roll right input should cause the drone to momentarily tilt right. If it does not respond, the p is too low. If it starts to move right, then the roll input is too long and needs to be shorter.). Repeat the impulse inputs a few times and observe the immediate response to the step input while discarding any external interferences(such as wind or lose parts causing movements). Tuning outdoors is unadvisable(aside from autotune) because of this. Do note that if tuning is conducted midair, always use the 5% increment button to avoid causing big changes in control to the drone and crashing. For a balanced x-frame, you can expect the roll and pitch pids to be roughly the same, which speeds up tuning. For a H frame with the weight distributed along the y axis of the craft, the roll p-pid should be lower than the pitch p-pid as it is easier to roll. The pid graph in PX4 is under Tuning-> Advanced Perimeters. The estimated(Red) is the actual position of the craft while the setpoint(green) is what is desired, therefore the setpoint should hug the estimated as close as possible.","title":"PID calibration procedure"},{"location":"advanced/pid_tuning/#1-p-maximum-value-possible","text":"Response Too high - high frequency oscillations(it will be both visible and audible) Too low - vehicle reacts too slowly Increase value until right before it starts oscillating in high frequency","title":"1) P, maximum value possible"},{"location":"advanced/pid_tuning/#2-d-minimum-value-possible","text":"Dampening Too high - motors become twitchy and hot(because it overcorrects too quickly, which creates high frequency noise) Too low - overshoot after step input Find Minimum value required so that it corrects quickly(see from graph) even after large step inputs","title":"2) D, minimum value possible"},{"location":"advanced/pid_tuning/#3-i-balanced","text":"Error Too high - slow oscillations ( as it slowly tries to correct) Too low - drift, HIGH FREQUENCY OSCILLATION AFTER STEP INPUT Increase if drifts in wind/external conditions, decrease if it corrects too slowly/little Recommended values are 0.3-0.5 on PX4 wiki Arguably, this is one of the hardest parts of setting up a drone as it requires experience to isolate and identify the actual response. Isolate - ideally speaking, tuning should be done in an indoor environment without wind but since that is not always possible with bigger drones and lack of space, just be aware that external factors such as wind can cause the response to move on its own. Do not overcompensate for it. Identify - One common issue is identifying high frequency oscillations from low frequency oscillations when first starting out. The default PIDs from PX4 are deliberately set low for safety but it can be more than doubled on some drones. The biggest tell of high frequency oscillations is that it should be very hard to even take off(unlike low frequency which is still often possible). The drone should both visibly and audibly be constantly vibrating and trying to correct, with little or not control as a result. As one might be unable to differentiate high from low frequency oscillations when tuning for the first time, the P tuning might be stopped at a much lower value than what the craft is actually capable of. Considering the size and price of the platform, it is understandable why this is more of an issue as compared to tuning an acro quad. Hence, it maybe useful to do a preliminary tuning of P,D,I and after it is sufficiently stable continue trying to increase P until it is uncontrollable. The live graphs for PID tuning can be found from the advanced option under the tuning tab. The parameters can be tuned on the fly incrementally.","title":"3) I, balanced"},{"location":"advanced/pid_tuning/#example-tuning-process","text":"Here are some images of a tuning process that will perhaps help to judge the feedback of your drone. It is by no means ideal but should aid in helping you to read the graph if you are struggling with identifying what is going on. Do not be overly reliant on the graphs, visual identification and the pilot feedback are as important when tuning. As previously mentioned, try inputting impulse commands with P and no I or D. In this picture, the response is smaller than the command. Hence, the P has to be increased for increased responsiveness of the drone and to ensure that the graphs are closer to one another. When the drone starts exhibiting high frequency oscillations, either reduce the P or start adding in D together with P if more responsiveness is still desired. In this graph, the drone oscillates after an impulse input. More D is required to dampen the response quicker. This graph looks pretty okay but the response looks abit slow so the I can be reduced.

Check the position sensor data for un-realistic data jumps. If data quality looks OK, perform an accel and gyro calibration and restart the vehicle. The check is controlled by the COM_ARM_EKF_POS parameter. PREFLIGHT FAIL: EKF YAW ERROR: This error is produced when the yaw angle estimated using gyro data and the yaw angle from the magnetometer or external vision system are inconsistent. Check the IMU data for large yaw rate offsets and check the magnetometer alignment and calibration. The check is controlled by the COM_ARM_EKF_POS parameter PREFLIGHT FAIL: EKF HIGH IMU ACCEL BIAS: This error is produced when the IMU accelerometer bias estimated by the EKF is excessive. The check is controlled by the COM_ARM_EKF_AB parameter. PREFLIGHT FAIL: EKF HIGH IMU GYRO BIAS: This error is produced when the IMU gyro bias estimated by the EKF is excessive.

PREFLIGHT FAIL: ACCEL SENSORS INCONSISTENT - CHECK CALIBRATION: This error message is produced when the acceleration measurements from different IMU units are inconsistent.

PREFLIGHT FAIL: EKF INTERNAL CHECKS: This error message is generated if the innovation magnitudes of either the horizontal GPS velocity, magnetic yaw, vertical GPS velocity or vertical position sensor (Baro by default but could be range finder or GPS if non-standard parameters are being used) are excessive. Innovations are the difference between the value predicted by the inertial navigation calculation and measured by the sensor. Users should check the innovation levels in the log file to determine the cause. These can be found under the ekf2_innovations message. Common problems/solutions include: IMU drift on warmup. May be resolved by restarting the autopilot. May require an IMU accel and gyro calibration. Adjacent magnetic interference combined with vehicle movement. Resolve my moving vehicle and waiting or re-powering. Bad magnetometer calibration combined with vehicle movement. Resolve by recalibrating. Initial shock or rapid movement on startup that caused a bad inertial nav solution. Resolve by restarting the vehicle and minimizing movement for the first 5 seconds. Other Parameters # The following parameters also affect preflight checks. COM_ARM_WO_GPS The COM_ARM_WO_GPS parameter controls whether or not arming is allowed without a global position estimate. 1 (default): Arming is allowed without a position estimate for flight modes that do not require position information (only). 0: Arming is allowed only if EKF is providing a global position estimate and EFK GPS quality checks are passing COM_ARM_EKF_YAW The COM_ARM_EKF_YAW parameter determines the maximum difference (in radians) between the navigation yaw angle and magnetic yaw angle (magnetometer or external vision) allowed before preflight checks fail. The default value of 0.5 allows the differences to be no more than 50% of the maximum tolerated by the EKF and provides some margin for error increase when flight commences. It can fail if the yaw gyro has a large offset or if the vehicle is moved or rotated in the presence of a bad magnetic interference or magnetometer calibration. PX4 Sensors # Certain important advice. Ensure that the EKF2_AID_MASKS is changed to allow for visual or gps fusion The 1.10 firmware allow for configuration on sensors on multiple port instead of only running on the default one. For example, the SENS_TFMINI_CFG parameter. However, do note that this selection is based on the SERIAL PORTS ON THE ORIGINAL PIXHAWK 1 (https://www.mathworks.com/help/supportpkg/px4/ref/port-mapping-for-serial.html). So, if you were using the GPS2 port on the pixhawk 2, which is the /dev/ttyS6 port, you would need to choose the relevant S6 port on the pixhawk 1 which is serial 4. (The UART port on the pixhawk 4 is serial 4 too). Take note that you can still manually start the sensor with but if the correct serial port is chosen it should automatically start everytime. TF Mini # By default on 1.8.2, PX4 reads the rangefinder port at SERIAL4/GPS2 which corresponds to the/dev/tty/S6. the port can be rebound with SENS_TFMINI_CFG on later versions. Ensure that SENS_EN_TFMINI is activated depending on firmware version. RNG AID should be enabled too. Use the mavlink console to probe if the driver is running. tfmini start -d /dev/tty/S6 tfmini status Related params EKF2_HGT_MODE - changes the primary height data source, still uses other for fusing EKF2_RNG_AID -can be enabled to reduce the barometer inaccuracies caused by ground effect if the range sensor is not the primary sensor. MPC_ALT_MODE - follow altitude or terrain Use the listener distance_sensor command to test if it still works. A distance_sensor tab should pop up too. Heres a useful link for pixhawk fc serial port mapping Optical Flow # Before attempting to implement optical flow for the first time, read through this entire page . Aside from the obvious stuff like ensuring that the orientation and the offsets of the optical flow sensor is correct, ensure that a separate downward facing rangefinder is used (barometer is not allowed) and that integrated_xgyro and integrated_x,.. are the same. For sensors without an integrated imu, integrated_xgyro will show nan and integrated_x will not correspond with HIGHRES_IMU/xgyro. If connected to PX4 via (USB) MAVLink the Optical Flow device must publish to the OPTICAL_FLOW_RAD topic, and the distance sensor must publish to the DISANCE_SENSOR topic. Only then can fusing occur. To view this topic over telem, the param MAV_1_MODE can be changed from normal to onboard to force all the messages to be sent. This can be checked with the command mavlink status . Do note that this causes other issues such as inability to pick up impulse inputs on the graph during PID Tuning, so any mavlink driver is set to this during tuning. Aside from that, diagnosing flow issues are abit harder due to the lack of feedback in PX4. Do check your 1)orientation 2)altitude(needs to be high enough) and 3)mpc_xy_vel pids 4) flow sensor offset with EKF2_OF_POS . If tuning is still required, try reducing the mpc_xy_vel_p to 0.08. If that does not help, try changing mpc_xy_vel_d before touching the other mpc params but do note that it should not need to be changed much as the defaults should work okay with the . Hereflow # Take note that on pre 2019 pixhawk 2.1 boards the can 1 and can 2 boards are swapped. The hereflow should be plugged in on the can 1 port by default. The following links contain the required perimeters for it. Hereflow PMW3901 Do note that as of 1.10 the downward rangefinder does not seem to be supported. Hence, a seperate downward facing rangefinder might be needed. The status of the hereflow can be checked with the mavlink commands UAVCAN status and listener optical_flow . Do note that the optical flow mavlink messages are not broadcasted over telem(in PX4) by default to save bandwidth. Do note that the x and y axis in the hereflow manual seems to be swapped in px4 Personally, I had issues getting the hereflow to work in the horizontal position so I placed it in the vertical position with the circle on the pmw3901 facing the back. Here+/2 GPS # Considerations These errors show up as generic errors in qgc and is not diagnosable via logs Ideally the base and rover antenna to have clear view of the sky that is 30 degrees above horizon. To attain GPS lock look for open spaces with view of sky instead of indoor areas Place GPS away from other electronic devices which generate noise. Eg, FC, other antennas, wifi antennas, power transformers and anything that emits EM/radio waves. https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-magnetic-interference.html#common-magnetic-interference Likewise with the Pixhawk FCU, dampening might be required Time-To-First-Fix 123 GPS & GLONASS GPS & BeiDou GPS Cold Start 26S 28S 29S Hot Start 1S 1S 1S Aided Starts 2S 3S 2S Here+ /Here+ v2 LED Meaning # [PROOFREADING NEEDED]There are 3 LEDs on the Here2, two at the side which are the UI LED and one in the center which should flash red with an emergency stop button in the center.

For sensors without an integrated imu, integrated_xgyro will show nan and integrated_x will not correspond with HIGHRES_IMU/xgyro. If connected to PX4 via (USB) MAVLink the Optical Flow device must publish to the OPTICAL_FLOW_RAD topic, and the distance sensor must publish to the DISANCE_SENSOR topic. Only then can fusing occur. To view this topic over telem, the param MAV_1_MODE can be changed from normal to onboard to force all the messages to be sent. This can be checked with the command mavlink status . Do note that this causes other issues such as inability to pick up impulse inputs on the graph during PID Tuning, so any mavlink driver is set to this during tuning. Aside from that, diagnosing flow issues are abit harder due to the lack of feedback in PX4. Do check your 1)orientation 2)altitude(needs to be high enough) and 3)mpc_xy_vel pids 4) flow sensor offset with EKF2_OF_POS . If tuning is still required, try reducing the mpc_xy_vel_p to 0.08.

Warning While this is the first section, this should always be put on LAST only after all other checks have been performed.

Betaflight default X-frame quadcopter prop configuration You would notice that the Motors marked 1 and 4 spin clockwise and the Motors marked 2 and 3 spin anticlockwise. Before placing the propellers, ensure that the correct CW/CCW propellers are used for the correct motors . Tip Some motors, typically older ones, come with self tightning nuts instead of locknuts. If the motors spin clockwise, the nut will be tightened anticlockwise(and vice versa). This prevents the propellers from loosening during flight. Different frame configurations will have different motor directions. When in doubt, refer to the documentation on the flightstack(betaflight/PX4/Ardupilot) itself. Power Distribution Board (PDB) # Supplies power from the battery to the motors and converts the battery voltage to 5V for the flight controller, regulates power input to prevent the electronics onboard from damaging levels of power. The PDB should be orientated such that the big solder pads for the battery terminals should be mounted in the right orientation so that the battery leads can be easily accessed. Certain PDBs have S1,S2,S3,S4 connections which can be used to wire up motor PWM inputs. In this case, ensure that the S1,S2,S3,S4 corresponds to Motor1,M2,M3,M4. A ribbon cable or wire harness is used to connect the motor inputs to the main flight controller. However the purpose of this is to simplify wiring, there are ports to connect the motor inputs on the flight controller itself. Motors # The Motors spin and generate thrust when used with the propellers. They have CW(clockwise) and CCW(Counter clockwise) orientations denoted by the colored screw caps which is threaded in the opposite direction from the rotation to self tighten and prevent propellers from flying out. If the motor spins in the wrong direction Swap any of the 2 motor wires Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) # These circuits help to regulate the speed of the motors, they take a signal from the flight controller and draw power from the Battery to drive the motor. For smaller drones, you can find an esc all in one combined with a PDB or even built into the FC but larger drones usually have standalone ESCs for each motor due to the high power drawn. 4 in 1 ESC Board Standalone ESC On Standalone ESCs, There will be 3 motor wires on one side of the board, and 4 or 5 wires on the other side of the board. On the other side with 4 or 5 wires, two of the wires are for battery voltage and battery ground and will be soldered to the PDB. These wires are thicker than the other wires to carry more current. The other wires are for signal,ground and sometimes telemetry. The signal should be plugged into the S1/S2/S3/S4 ports respectively and the ground can be plugged into any ground port. Batteries (Lipo) # The batteries come with many different chemistries but generally we use the term LiPos (short for Lithium Polymer). LiPos have a high rate of discharge which allows the motor to suck more current than regular batteries. This is made possible by the low resistance which is essential for the application of drones due to the high current that is drawn by the motors. As a result, a single short across the positive and negative wires is enough to kill the battery and cause an electrical fire due to the low internal resistance unlike AA/AAA batteries. Special precaution has to be taken when handling lipos to prevent puncture of cells or overcharge/discharge. Discharging # A single lipo cell usually has a voltage of 4.2V when full and 3.3V when empty. Overdischarging or overcharging results in the battery spoiling. LiPos have a maximum discharge rate which can be calculated from the C rating on the battery using this equation: \\[ \\frac{\\text{Capcity in mAh}}{1000} \\times \\text{C rating} \\] Charging # In terms of charging, the safest rate to charge lipos is at 1C or 1A per 1000mah(battery capacity). So a 500mah battery would charge at 0.5A. Different manufacturers can specify different maximum charge and discharge rates for the battery but to preserve battery health a charge rate of 1C is advised. Lipo chargers allow for charging to HV(4.35V instead of 4.2v) and some do not automatically set a safe current/voltage when charging so do be careful about that. Storage # For long term storage, lipos have to be discharged or charged to 3.8V which is slightly above the nominal voltage of 3.7V. This is known as storage charging . Radio Controllers/Transmitter # This transmits a radio signal which is picked up by the receiver on the drone. Radio controllers can have a module bay to add different transmitter modules. Most radio controllers can transmit around 6-12 channels with higher end controllers having up to 18 or more channels. Each channel has an analog value and corresponds to one control such as pitch, yaw or something else. To reduce the need of having one signal and ground wire for each individual channel, protocols are used to transmit multiple channels on a single pin/wire (with 1 ground) such as sbus, ppm, cppm, etc. Do note that the different protocol eg ppm,sbus might need to be defined in both the flight controller software and on the controller itself. Documentation on the configuration required can be found by searching individual recievers and radio controllers. Receivers # Receivers receive the radio input transmitted by the radio controller. There are many different transmission protocols made by different manufacturers such as Frsky,Flysky,Futaba,etc. All of which require a compatible transmitter(on the radio) and receiver talking on the same protocol. Even within a same manufacturer, there are different protocols that are incompatible with each other ! Configuration can be done on the flight controller software(betaflight), and the radio transmitter and varies on different manufacturers.

Many resources regarding this topic is avaliable online and betaflight recommends that you tune it in acro which is hard given the skill required for it and the space constraints. For now, here is the difference between PID and rates. PID controls the responsiveness and reaction of the quadcopter. This settings are used by the flight controller in all flight modes. Rate controls the sensitivity of your drone from your transmitter. Higher rate means that the drone is move sensitive and moves faster while lower means the drone moves slower but gives more resolution on movements. The degrees/s at the end indicate how fast the drone can turn at full stick deflection in a given second. It is important to note that this rates do not control how to flight controller handles the drone but rather how sensitive your inputs on your radio transmitter are. Rate profile are given in curves, which allows for lower sensitivity and more precise movements in the middle but the higher sensitivity at the end allows for the pilot to do large maneuvers when the sticks are deflected to the end.","title":"Software and Configuration"},{"location":"basic/software_and_configuration/#software-and-configuration","text":"","title":"Software and Configuration"},{"location":"basic/software_and_configuration/#flight-stack","text":"Also known as the Firmware, the Flight Stack is the software which runs on the Flight Controller There are several popular Flight Stacks out there(some of which are forks of others) but the three main ones that we use are Betaflight ( Used primarily for racing/simple crafts ) PX4 Ardupilot To configure these firmware's, these various software's are used: - Betaflight Configurator for Betaflight - QGroundControl for PX4 - Mission Planner for Ardupilot For simple flying/racing, betaflight is used but for drones that requires additional sensors or intelligence, PX4 or Ardupilot is used.

Some of the information might be relevant to regular drone competitions that MRS participates in, namely SAFMC and AAVC. This is by no means extensive of what is needed to be known for those competitions nor is it fully fact checked.

If failure to change to auto mode error comes up check this. Use simulation tab to verify flight plan. 3 Levels of Arbitrarily defined Autonomy for AAVC 2020,0 points for full manual, 2 points for waypoint(lvl 1), 4 for dynamically generated waypoints(lvl 2), 6 for automatically generated waypoints(lvl 3) which refers to pushing a single button or something like that. Do not sacrifice points for autonomy over accuracy (if the former has less total points). If your CV solution cannot detect it reliably just take over and drop it near the target Digital and Analog video transmission systems can interfere with each other, test before using It might be required to perform EMI shielding on certain electronics such as the Jetson or RPI to prevent it affecting the GPS, if that still does not work, increase the height of the GPS(away from the frame) with standoffs There will be multiple mannequins, be sure to check with the organizer the exact search area A cloth will be pasted on the injured area and the correct one will be face up With analog video(and possible digital) the mannequins cannot be identified at 20m. The drone has to descent either manually or autonomously for human or AI detection as it is simply too small(with the default wide angle cameras). For AAVC 2020 the altitude was 2-45m not 20-45m. Spec'ing # For AAVC 2020 we speced the drone using the weight of the payload and the rough weight of the drone with generic parts. Then, we searched for efficient motors and high density batteries to fit the drone. The propellers and ESC are based on the motor requirements and the previously tested controllers were used for the FC and GPS. However, this might not be the ideal way to do it. Ecalc Guide Some personal thoughts on frame and drone type in 2019 # IMO with motors becoming more powerful and efficient such as the T-Motor U line, at least for a drone with an overall weight of 15kg it makes more sense to use four of these motors in a quad configuration(instead of a hexa or octaquad) to reduce the power draw, complexity and weight. To achieve this efficiency, large propellers have to be used which increases the frame size. This makes CF Rods/Square Tubes an ideal choice of material(due to its accessibility and ease of fabrication) as CF plates are not stiff enough and heavy in larger sheets which makes it impractical to use as a frame the larger it gets. The use of CF Rods in commercial drone with large propellers such as the DJI Matrice and the Freefly Alta X shows that perhaps using CF Rods as arms might be the effective option. Two of the more common motor designs for the quadrotor class are the x-frame and the h-frame designs. These configurations do not directly define the body of the drones but influence the design of the supporting structures and hence indirectly the weight. Though there are many variations of motor configurations involving different distances between the motors, IMO the difference is negligible when flying missions as the weight distribution matters more. IMO the x-frame configuration and its variants are harder to use as an test/mission platform over a h-frame/box-frame due to the following reasons. 1) The h-frame/box-frame is more rigid as the body has more connected rods/joints than a x-frame. Trying to remedy this on a x-frame with more rods turns the design into effectively a h-frame. This is important considering the drone has to withstand abuse and crashes. This also ties in to the relatively easier construction/CAD of the h-frame which does not need to have angled parts or a fixed base plate unlike the x frame. 2) The h-frame offers a large mounting area in between the two CF body rods while mounting on a x-frame arguably requires more planning as the base plate will have to be recut (or remoulded) to mount components differently. Dont take this as META, if you are reading this you probably are just starting out with drones so its okay to try something more tested but experimental drones will teach you more at the end of the day so dont be afraid to expierement. Checklists # Drone flying is an activity that has its fair share of troubleshooting required as well as hazards. The following checklists are practises that MRS Members have gained through experience to reduce the amount of troubleshooting required as well as to prevent accidents from happening Assembly Checks # Visual Inspection Check Motors and ESC, number/pin and direction; Calibration Calibrate all sensors(accelerometer, level, magnetometer/compass) Preflight Checks( Do in reverse after Landing ) # Visual Inspection for missing or cracked/broken parts Mechanical parts secured, arms not wobbling Check that motor screws are of correct length and not overtightened, can cause scraping feeling if screws are too long and scrapes the motor housing Check FPV Camera housing taken out Check Mode Switch Check Payload Switch Mount propellers and bushing(if applicable) Check for any errors in Mission Control/QGC Check FPV Camera Feed Check clear of people and nearby hazards Recommended Roles within Teams # Pilot - flies drone/ operates RC transmitter Backup Pilot - might be required standing beside to the pilot for long range mission where the pilot flies FPV and the backup pilot can take over during LOS Ground Control - Observes and provides audio feedback to pilot regarding flight status, flight mode, battery, error states, etc Spotter - ensures safety of other people and the surrounding, eg weather condition, birds, other drones, intervenes only if there is threat to mission or nearby people FPV - for spotting objects/mannequin during mission Mission Planner vs QGC # There are differences between PX4 and Ardupilot and their target platforms which can be found online. To simplify things for now all you need to know is that Ardupilot is a flight control software in which Mission Planner is the program you download to configure it while PX4 is yet another flight control software in which QGroundControl(QGC) is the program used to configure it. Hardware wise usually the same flight controllers are compatible with both of them but Ardupilot seems to support newer sensors faster. In AAVC 2020, we used Ardupilot for two main reasons Auto PID Tuning on Ardupilot Ardupilot allows for automatic PID Tuning which can be bound to a switch under the config/tuning-> extended tuning page. Param AUTOTUNE_AXES can be set to individually tune one axis at a time so that the battery does not run flat. The drone has to be landed while in PID Mode for the PID to be saved. Link This saves alot of time normally spent tuning(especially as beginners) as it is hard to tune large drones in SUTD Servo Release without Mixing Ardupilot has many presets for mixing the main and auxiliary outputs as unlike PX4 which required mixing for actuation of a servo. By making use of the camera shutter functionality, the payload can be triggered via DIGICAM_CONTROL during missions or bound to a switch. On the pixhawk cube (2), RC8 is Main 8 and RC9 is Aux 1, RC10 is Aux 2, etc... Link . Importantly, the RC ports on the pixhawk can all be set as either input or output. The RCx params control the input behaviour, but when RCx_OPTION is set to 0, the port is set as an an output with the output behaviours being controlled by the servo params . This includes the 4 motor pins which are automatically mixed from the 4 RC Inputs(throttle,yaw,pitch,roll) into the individual servo1,servo2,servo3,servo4 outputs. The full range of Auxiliary Functions can be found here . Other Advantages Ardupilot tends to be less anal about GPS errors compared to PX4 and Mission Planner also displays the errors too unlike QGC. Increased number of survey patterns and waypoint options. Spline waypoints provide a smooth path but are not required in missions. The amount of auxiliary functions(RCx_OPTION) that can be bound in Ardupilot without much additional effort. Out of the box support for obstacle avoidance with multiple sensors Support for less sensors. Atm it seems like ardupilot is being updated to support newer sensors more frequently than px4. More mission types in Ardupilot as compared to QGC Mission Planner # Heres a brief overview of mission planner which should aid in setting up basic missions for competitions. Do note that mission based GPS payload drop might not necessarily yield more points than a manual drop(depending on scoring). User Interface and Mission Setup # Near the left side of mission planner, there is a list of readings that can be changed by double clicking on it. Under Actions tab there are buttons for Takeoff, RTL, shutter, etc Near the top side middle there is a cockpit. It will display this green blue background by default but can be changed to accept fpv feed from an av to usb receiver or any video source. Any GPS or arming errors will pop up here too. On the top are the tabs, flight plan is used for planning flight paths and the main configuration is done through initial setup and config and tuning. Simulation is useful for error checking your flight plan to prevent any unforeseen errors or flyaway. Use it to verify your gps missions before competitions The Flight plan tab has changed through the many revisions, tutorials on youtube use different versions of mission planner but the main differences are the shifting of the polygon tool(to draw search and geofence areas) to the top left and the moving of geofencing to a separate display tab. Geofencing does not seem to work with mission mode but more testing is required to determine this. The commands will be executed sequentially according to the order given below. The commands are pretty self explanatory and can be searched up easily. A few notes, DO_DIGICAM_CONTROL activates shutter and DO_CHANGE_SPEED only requires the second term to be filled in to change ground speed. Always save at least 2 copies of the mission with the buttons on the right to make sure it is not accidentally overwritten and use the load WP and save WP buttons to save a temporary mission that is cleared on reboot. Right clicking on the maps gives you a bunch of options, prefetch can be used to download the map for offline areas. Creating multiple waypoints for a survey can be done through the autowp option. The full documentation is on the website but this should provide a basic understanding of what needs to be done for a mission. Hitting CTRL-F brings up the temp menu which hides a disgusting amount of buttons with useful features. Some of the helpful options for general use are highlighted here. Mavlink can be used to mirror the stream over a local network, which is useful for opening up another instance of GCS on another computer to observe other parameters. VLC allows for a usb vtx or another video source to be overlaid. This video provides some other useful tips of hidden Mission Planner Features.","title":"AAVC (Autonomous Aerial Vehicle Competition) Reference"},{"location":"competition/AAVC_reference/#aavc-autonomous-aerial-vehicle-competition-reference","text":"Facebook for announcements Website for rules Disclaimer from the authors This is a collection of notes taken down by past and present MRS members.
